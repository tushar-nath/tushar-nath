I am a software engineer passionate about System Architecture, Database Internals, and solving complex technical challenges. I specialize in scalable backend architectures, and seamless API integrations, with a strong focus on taking products and systems from 0 to 1.

In 2024, I joined [Gynoveda](https://www.gynoveda.com/) as a Software Engineer, where I engineered critical tools such as the Appointment Desk using NextJS and TypeScript, integrated APIs to streamline appointment management, and led the migration from Shopify to a custom solution. My role included implementing data pipelines to centralize lead and patient data and integrating Metabase for business intelligence.

Previously, I worked at [Matt Young Media](https://www.mattyoungmedia.com/), where I utilized AWS SQS and Lambda to efficiently manage delayed client requests, integrated Redis caching to enhance performance, and automated lead generation using LinkedIn APIs, significantly boosting conversion rates.

Earlier in my career, I interned with organizations like [Curiosify](https://www.linkedin.com/company/curiosify/), [My Analytics School](https://www.linkedin.com/company/my-analytics-school/), and [Kunhi Software Incubator](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kunhi-software-incubator/), gaining expertise in building RESTful APIs, designing interfaces from Figma prototypes, and implementing secure authentication systems using ReactJS and Spring Security.
